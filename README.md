# Disaster Tweet Analyzer 
A collaborative project to recognize disaster tweet in the sea of information in the Twitter realm. 

Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to send and receive information inrealtime. In thepast several years, Twitter has shown its great potential to spread awareness quickly when a natural disaster occurred, and this is done through its Tweet (message sent inTwitter). Because of that,the needed help can be obtained in a shorter period of time. However, with the vast amount of tweets being exchanged daily, it is highly important to be able to classify which tweets are actually reporting about natural disaster events. Therefore, in this project, our team is building a machine learning model that can classify which Tweets indicate true natural disasters events with greater than 77% accuracy. 

To determine the best model,we will measure the f1 score on the test set from each given model. The f1 score and computational cost trade off is also then being considered to determine the most optimal model. With only 22 variables input,the **Neural Network model** can produce 77.60% accuracy on the test.
